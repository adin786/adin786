# Azam Din (adin786)
I'm an MEng Mechanical Engineer with a software and data analytics specialism.  I'm learning Data Science and machine learning skills to maximise my value as a numerical and analytical problem solver.  This Github is my place to document a few of my projects, develop good software development practises and hopefully build some stories around data!

## ðŸ”­ Project summary
|Project name|Links|
|------------|-----|
|MOT data analysis|([More detail](#mot-data-analysis)) / ([Link to repo](https://github.com/adin786/mot-data))|

|DIC strain mapping data processing|([More detail](#dic-strain-mapping-data-processing) / (private repo)|

### MOT data analysis
*(In progress)* Analysing 30 million MOT test records from GOV.uk, trying to extract some insights and pick out trends about failure rates.  Tools I'm using: 
- SQLite and Pandas for ETL, loading and sorting large dataset
- Seaborn and Matplotlib for data visualisation and exploration
- Scikit-learn for model training, classification

### Titanic survivor prediction
...

### DIC strain mapping data processing
Commercial project. I've written a toolkit of python scripts and modules to take multi-million row point-cloud data files, aligns them all to a global coordinate system and exports the data into formatted csv files for a commercial client.  The data comes from a DIC (digital image correlation) image based inspection system for measuring mechanical behaviour of deforming structures in large scale bending tests.

### Other software projects in MatLab and Python
- Matlab GUI tool for data processing, visualisation and automation of Automotive ECU tuning
- ...

### ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ...
Data science, python, SQL, machine learning models, data transformation, mining and visualisation
