# Azam Din (adin786)
I'm an MEng Mechanical Engineer with a software and data analytics specialism.  I'm learning Data Science and machine learning skills to maximise my value as a numerical and analytical problem solver.  This Github is my place to document a few of my projects, develop good software development practises and hopefully build some stories around data!

### MOT data analysis
Analysing 30 million MOT test records from GOV.uk, trying to extract some insights and pick out trends about failure rates.  Tools I'm using: 
- SQLite and Pandas for ETL, loading and sorting large dataset
- Seaborn and Matplotlib for data visualisation and exploration
- Scikit-learn for model training, classification
- Libraries: SQLite, Pandas, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn

### Used car pricing
Modelled car pricing on Autotrader.co.uk to help decide on a selling price for my own Audi A6.
- Wrote a webscraper to extract 1000 adverts
- Analysed trends and extracted 11 features about the cars from each advert
- Trained a model to predict advert price
- Support vector model achieved r^2 of 0.97 and MAE of Â£961 on test data
- Most important features were `age` and `mileage`
- libraries: BeautifulSoup4, Pandas, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn

### Titanic survivor prediction
Predicted survival status for passengers onboard the Titanic cruise ship.  Dataset from www.kaggle.com
- Pandas and Seaborn for exploratory analysis
- Engineered features from text data like title and deck number. Engineered numerical features like family_size, ticket_frequency
- Trained, tuned and compared classifier models based on Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest
- Best model gave cross validation accuracy of 0.826 and AUC of 0.880.
- Libraries: Pandas, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn

### DIC strain mapping data processing
Commercial project. I've written a toolkit of python scripts and modules to take multi-million row point-cloud data files, aligns them all to a global coordinate system and exports the data into formatted csv files for a commercial client.  The data comes from a DIC (digital image correlation) image based inspection system for measuring mechanical behaviour of deforming structures in large scale bending tests.

### Other software projects in MatLab and Python
