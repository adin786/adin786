### Job market analysis 
 I created and deployed an NLP job title classifier to automatically classify job titles based on the description text: 
- Wrote a web-scraper to extract over 2000 job adverts from uk.indeed.com
- Manually extracted “skill tags” for each role (Python, Cloud, Machine Learning etc).
- Deployed the model as a web-app using StreamLit, allowing anyone to classify a job as ‘Data Scientist’, ‘Data Analyst’, or ‘Data Engineer’.
- Libraries: Requests, BeautifulSoup4 Pandas NTLK Seaborn Scikit-learn Streamlit

### MOT data analysis

Analysing 30 million MOT test records from GOV.uk, trying to extract some insights and pick out trends about failure rates.  Tools I'm using: 
- SQLite and Pandas for ETL, loading and sorting large dataset
- Seaborn and Matplotlib for data visualisation and exploration
- Scikit-learn for model training, classification
- Libraries: SQLite, Pandas, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn

### Used car pricing analysis

Modelled car pricing on Autotrader.co.uk to help decide on a selling price for my own Audi A6.
- Wrote a webscraper to extract 1000+ adverts
- Analysed trends and extracted 11 features about the cars from each advert
- Tuned a Support Vector Regression model which achieved r^2 of 0.97 and MAE of £961
- Most important features were `age` and `mileage`
- libraries: BeautifulSoup4, Pandas, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn

### Titanic survivor prediction

Predicted survival status for passengers onboard the Titanic cruise ship.  Dataset from www.kaggle.com
- Pandas and Seaborn for exploratory analysis
- Engineered features from text data like title and deck number. Engineered numerical features like family_size, ticket_frequency
- Trained, tuned and compared classifier models based on Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest
- Best model gave cross validation accuracy of 0.83 and AUC of 0.88.
- Libraries: Pandas, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn

### DIC strain mapping data processing
Commercial project. I've written a toolkit of python scripts and modules to take multi-million row point-cloud data files, aligns them all to a global coordinate system and exports the data into formatted csv files for a commercial client.  The data comes from a DIC (digital image correlation) image based inspection system for measuring mechanical behaviour of deforming structures in large scale bending tests.  Inluded creating a GUI for data filtering and extraction

### Other software projects in MatLab and Python
- Matlab GUI tool for data processing, visualisation and automation of Automotive ECU tuning
