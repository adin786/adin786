# Azam Din (adin786)
I'm an MEng Mechanical Engineer with a software and data analytics specialism.  I'm learning Data Science and machine learning skills to maximise my value as a numerical and analytical problem solver.  This Github is my place to document a few of my projects, develop good software development practises and hopefully build some stories around data!

### ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on ...
#### Personal project - MOT data analysis
In progress project using data on 30 million MOT test records from GOV.uk, trying to extract some insights and pick out trends about failure rates.  I've used Pandas and SQL and am preparint the data to train some machine learning experiments in Scikit-learn.  I'll mostly be looking at class 4 vehicles and exclude heavy goods vehicles etc.

Hypotheses or things I want to try with this data include:
- Is there a trend between features like vehicle make, model, vehicle age, mileage etc and the actual test pass rates?  
  - OR: it could be ratio of passes vs attempts, since I guess most cars eventually are repaired until they pass?
- What about the vehicles that failed the MOT but didn't re-test successfully.  Can these be classed as a more severe class of "test-fail" might try some feature engineering to see if this changes any of the observations.
- Putting aside MOT pass/fails, I can use the database to do some descriptive statistics, or visualisations of the population of vehicles in active use around the country.  There's also geographical data included, I could try some more complex visualisations with this.
- Build a machine learning model that uses features like make, model, mileage, postcode, etc, to predict the probability of MOT pass on first attempt.

Results: Not ready to show anything here yet.

#### Project - DIC strain point cloud data processing automation
Non-public project where I've written a toolkit of python scripts and modules to take multi-million row point-cloud data files, aligns them all to a global coordinate system and exports the data into formatted csv files for a commercial client.  The data comes from a DIC (digital image correlation) image based inspection system for measuring mechanical behaviour of deforming structures in large scale bending tests.
